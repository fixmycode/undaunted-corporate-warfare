# What's this

This is a card, token and tile generator for **Undaunted: Corporate Warfare**, a mod for Osprey Games' **Undaunted: North Africa**. This game takes the players to near-future Tokyo, where a resistance has been formed against the coup-de-etat made by the Futura Corporation.

## Where are the assets?

They will be available when ready. Right now the game is being tested with placeholder copyrighted images that can't be distributed to Github.

## How do I run it

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
